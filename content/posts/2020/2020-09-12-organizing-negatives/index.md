I've finally taken my film negatives out of the moving boxes and given them proper space on shelves in my office.

I don't know why I bother, since I almost never actually look at them. Maybe I'm just comforted knowing there right there.


I wish I would have been more consistent in how I filed them. I've used hanging folders, individual sleeves, and several different types of binders over the years. Now I'm using binder sleeves with integrated contact sheet holders in archival binders, but things got a bit messy there for a while.

Since I'm not shooting much new 35mm lately, I may dig through the archives and print some of my favorites, so having them handy should help.
