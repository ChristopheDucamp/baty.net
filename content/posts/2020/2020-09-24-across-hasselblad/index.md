I ran into the above photo from 2010 and it jumped right out at me. I am a huge fan of the way the Zeiss lenses on the Hasselblad render, but this one had a little extra something. 

I dug out the original negative and of course it was Acros 100. I didn't realize I was missing Acros after they stopped making it but now I wish I had more of it.
