I was just let into the [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) beta in Github.

I'm interested in this for ad-hoc development in a browser or in my iPad. As a test, I created this post in Codespaces via Safari.

Typed this and committed it all right in Safari in a VS Code-like environment. It was all easy and could definitely come in handy for my workflow.
